Hello everybody!
It's my first cycle in Crypto and I'm pretty much excited.
Cheers!

Hello everybody!
I became a solidity dev and I'm building a boilerplate for smart contract companies.
I can count on my team of 4 brave and intellectual friends as well as our community that now extends for more than 50 people, to help us build 4 projects simultaneously.
Cheers!
